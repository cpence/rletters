# Base class for all jobs in the application

# Analysis jobs have two special partials that can be implemented to
# engage novel behavior:
#
# - `_params.html.haml` (optional): If this view is present, then after the
#   task has collected the appropriate number of datasets, the user will be
#   presented with this form in order to set special parameters for the
#   task.  This partial should consist of a form that submits to
#   `dataset_tasks_path` with `:post` (`datasets/tasks#create`).
# - `results.html.haml` (optional): If this view is present, then after the
#   task is completed, the user will be offered a link to view this template
#   in addition to whatever downloadable file results the task produces.
