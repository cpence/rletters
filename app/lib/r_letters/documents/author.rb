      # 1. If a name is submitted by the user as a single letter, it will be
      #    searched with a wildcard.
      # 2. If a name is submitted by the user *not* as a single letter, it will
      #    result in two queries, one with the full name and one with an
      #    initial.
      # 3. If multiple initials in a row are present, then we combine them into
      #    a single search term.
