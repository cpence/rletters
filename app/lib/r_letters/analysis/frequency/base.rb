      # Interface for all word frequency analyzers
      #
      # This is an interface implemented by all word frequency analyzer
      # classes. Currently we have two, one of which analyzes quickly by simply
      # combining the `tf` values from the term vectors, and another which
      # analyzes much more slowly by reconstructing the full text from the
      # `offsets` variable.

      # @!attribute dataset
      #   @return [Dataset] the dataset to analyze
      # @!attribute progress
      #   @return [Proc] if set, a function to call with percentage of
      #     completion (one integer parameter)
      # @!attribute block_size
      #   @return [Integer] block size, in words
      #
      #   If this attribute is zero, then we will read from `num_blocks`
      #   instead.  Defaults to zero.
      # @!attribute num_blocks
      #   @return [Integer] number of blocks for splitting
      #
      #   If this attribute is zero, we will read from `block_size` instead.
      #   Defaults to zero.
      # @!attribute split_across
      #   @return [Boolean] whether to split blocks across documents
      #
      #   If this is set to true, then we will effectively concatenate all
      #   the documents before splitting into blocks.  If false, we'll
      #   split blocks on a per-document basis.  Defaults to true.
      # @!attribute last_block
      #   @return [Symbol] this parameter changes what will
      #     happen to the "leftover" words when +block_size+ is set.
      #
      #     [+:big_last+]      add them to the last block, making a block
      #       larger than +block_size+.
      #     [+:small_last+]    make them into their own block, making a block
      #       smaller than +block_size+.
      #     [+:truncate_last+] truncate those leftover words, excluding them
      #       from frequency computation.
      #     [+:truncate_all+]  truncate _every_ text to +block_size+, creating
      #       only one block per call to +#add+
      #
      #     The default is +:big_last+.
      # @!attribute ngrams
      #   @return [Integer] if set, return ngrams rather than single words.
      #     Can be set to any integer >= 1.  Defaults to 1.
      # @!attribute num_words
      #   @return [Integer] if set, only return frequency data for this many
      #     words; otherwise, return all words.  If +ngrams+ is available and
      #     set, this is a number of ngrams, not a number of words.
      # @!attribute stemming
      #   @return [Symbol] if set to +:stem+, pass the words through a Porter
      #     stemmer before returning them.  If set to +:lemma+, pass them
      #     through a lemmatizer. Defaults to no stemming.
      # @!attribute all
      #   @return [Boolean] if set, ignore `num_words` and simply return all
      #     words (or ngrams)
      # @!attribute inclusion_list
      #   @return [String] if specified, then the analyzer will only compute
      #     frequency information for the words that are specified in this
      #     list (which is space-separated).
      #
      #     If +ngrams+ is available and set, then this works differently.
      #     This list is assumed to be a space-separated list of single words.
      #     Ngrams will only be analyzed, then, if the ngram contains _at
      #     least one_ of the words found in +inclusion_list+.
      # @!attribute exclusion_list
      #   @return [String] if specified, then the  analyzer will *not* compute
      #     frequency information for the words that are specified in this
      #     list (which is space-separated).
      #
      #     If +ngrams+ is available and set, then this works differently.
      #     This list is assumed to be a space-separated list of single words.
      #     If an ngram contains _any of the words_ in this list, then it will
      #     not be analyzed.
      # @!attribute stop_list
      #   @return [Array<String>] if specified, then the analyzer will
      #     *not* compute frequency information for the words that appear
      #     within this stop list.  Cannot be used if +ngrams+ is set.
      # @!attribute [r] blocks
      #   @return [Array<Hash<String, Integer>>] The analyzed blocks of text
      #    (array of hashes of term frequencies)
      # @!attribute [r] block_stats
      #   Information about each block.
      #
      #   Each hash in this array (one per block) has :name, :types, and
      #   :tokens keys.
      #
      #   @return [Array<Hash>] Block information
      # @!attribute [r] word_list
      #   @return [Array<String>] The list of words (or ngrams) analyzed
      # @!attribute [r] tf_in_dataset
      #   @return [Hash<String, Integer>] For each word (or ngram), how many
      #     times that word occurs in the dataset
      # @!attribute [r] df_in_dataset
      #   @return [Hash<String, Integer>] For each word (or ngram), the number
      #     of documents in the dataset in which that word appears
      # @!attribute [r] num_dataset_tokens
      #   @return [Integer] The number of tokens in the dataset.  If `ngrams`
      #     is set, this is the number of ngrams.
      # @!attribute [r] num_dataset_types
      #   @return [Integer] The number of types in the dataset.  If `ngrams`
      #     is set, this is the number of distinct ngrams.
      # @!attribute [r] df_in_corpus
      #   @return [Hash<String, Integer>] For each word (or ngram), the number
      #     of documents in the entire corpus in which that word appears
