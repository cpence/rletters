RLetters is an application designed to let users perform complex searches as well as digital-humanities and text-mining analysis tasks on a corpus of journal articles.

## Features ##

### Complex search ###

The Solr backend on which RLetters is based allows for a number of complicated searching operations:

-   Boolean operators ("darwin OR huxley")
-   Wildcard search ("*fish" or "wom?n")
-   Text stemming ("evolution" matching "evolutionary" or "evolutionist")
-   Fuzzy matching (matching words similar to the requested term)
-   Proximity searching (two terms within N words of one another)

### Text analysis ###

RLetters allows users to save the results of a given search as a "dataset."  This produces a saved record that users can return to later in order to perform text analysis tasks.

While text analysis tasks are a current area of active development in RLetters, currently the following are available:

-   Graph dataset by year
-   Export dataset as citations in a variety of formats
-   Show complete table of term frequency information (for datasets consisting of a single document)

### Support for web and library standards ###

RLetters provides support for the following web and library standards:

-   [unAPI](http://unapi.info) for automatic bibliographic data retrieval from individual documents
-   [WorldCat OpenURL Registry](http://www.oclc.org/developer/services/worldcat-registry) for detection of the OpenURL resolver of the user's local library

And you can export bibliographic data in the following standard formats:

-   [MARC 21 transmission format](http://www.loc.gov/marc/)
-   [MARCXML](http://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/)
-   [MARC-JSON (draft)](http://www.oclc.org/developer/content/marc-json-draft-2010-03-11)
-   [MODS](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/)
-   [RDF/XML](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/) (using [Dublin Core Grammar](http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-citation-guidelines/))
-   [RDF/N3](http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3.html) (using [Dublin Core Grammar](http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-citation-guidelines/))
-   [BibTeX](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/bibtex)
-   [EndNote (ENW format)](http://www.endnote.com/)
-   [Reference Manager (RIS format)](http://www.refman.com/support/risformat_intro.asp)

### Cutting-edge development and maintenance tools ###

RLetters doesn't leave your developers out in the cold, either.  We've got support for the following features that make development, deployment, maintenance, and monitoring easier:

-   Server provisioning entirely handled [by Ansible](http://www.ansibleworks.com)
-   Track page views with [Google Analytics](http://google.com/analytics)
-   Source well-documented using [Yard](http://yardoc.org)
-   Continuous integration support with [Travis](http://travis-ci.org/)
-   Baked-in support for error reporting using [Airbrake](http://airbrake.io/) (account registration required)


## Installation / Deployment ##

See our detailed [installation and deployment](https://github.com/cpence/rletters/wiki/Installation-and-Deployment) guide for instructions.  For the extremely impatient:

    # Install Ansible 1.3+ from your local package manager
    # Establish passwordless SSH with passwordless sudo to your server running RHEL/CentOS 6
    git clone git://github.com/cpence/rletters.git

    cd rletters/deploy
    cp hosts.example hosts
    $EDITOR hosts
      # Point all these paths at your server
    ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml

    # Open up a web browser to http://YOUR_SITE/admin/
      # Log in with admin@example.com / password
      # CHANGE THOSE DEFAULT CREDENTIALS
      # Configure any other settings that strike your fancy

Also, several features of RLetters wouldn't be possible without the excellent work of other Ruby programmers.  Thanks in particular to those behind [Ansible,](http://www.ansibleworks.com/) [RSolr](https://github.com/mwmitchell/rsolr) and [RSolr::Ext](https://github.com/mwmitchell/rsolr-ext), [citeproc-ruby](https://github.com/inukshuk/citeproc-ruby), and [bibtex-ruby](https://github.com/inukshuk/bibtex-ruby).
