RLetters is an application designed to let users perform complex searches as well as digital-humanities and text-mining analysis tasks on a corpus of journal articles.

## Features

### Text analysis

RLetters allows users to save the results of a given search as a "dataset."  This produces a saved record that users can return to later in order to perform text analysis tasks.

While text analysis tasks are a current area of active development in RLetters, currently the following are available:

-   Compute term frequency information (for single words or multiple-word phrases)
-   Compare word usage in two different datasets
-   Graph dataset by publication date
-   Determine statistically significant pairs of words (collocations) or associations between words at distance (cooccurrences)
-   Compute network of words used around a focal word
-   Extract references to proper names (locations, people, organizations)
-   Export dataset as citations in a variety of formats

### Complex search

The Solr backend on which RLetters is based allows for a number of complicated searching operations:

-   Searching on the basis of particular fields ("year:2010", "authors:Johnson", or "title:fish")
-   Boolean operators ("darwin OR huxley")
-   Wildcard search ("*fish" or "wom?n")
-   Text stemming ("evolution" matching "evolutionary" or "evolutionist")
-   Fuzzy matching (matching words similar to the requested term)
-   Proximity searching (two terms within N words of one another)

### Support for web and library standards

RLetters features a [JSON API to return search results](http://docs.rletters.apiary.io/) to other services around the internet.  We also provide support for the following web and library standards:

-   [unAPI](http://unapi.info) for automatic bibliographic data retrieval from individual documents
-   [WorldCat OpenURL Registry](http://www.oclc.org/developer/services/worldcat-registry) for detection of the OpenURL resolver of the user's local library

And you can export bibliographic data in the following standard formats:

-   [MARC 21 transmission format](http://www.loc.gov/marc/)
-   [MARCXML](http://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/)
-   [MARC-JSON (draft)](http://www.oclc.org/developer/content/marc-json-draft-2010-03-11)
-   [MODS](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/)
-   [RDF/XML](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/) (using [Dublin Core Grammar](http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-citation-guidelines/))
-   [RDF/N3](http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3.html) (using [Dublin Core Grammar](http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-citation-guidelines/))
-   [BibTeX](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/bibtex)
-   [EndNote (ENW format)](http://www.endnote.com/)
-   [Reference Manager (RIS format)](http://www.refman.com/support/risformat_intro.asp)

### Cutting-edge development and maintenance tools

RLetters doesn't leave your developers out in the cold, either.  We've got speedy deployments on [Heroku,](https://www.heroku.com/) exception monitoring with [Sentry,](https://sentry.io/welcome/) and our code has a thorough test suite and adheres to a probably unnecessary level of linting and style-guide fanaticism.

Visit [the website](https://www.rletters.net/) for more developer information, especially our [deployment guide.](https://www.rletters.net/dev/heroku.html)

We also have received the help of a great community of translators at [Transifex.](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/rletters/)  Thanks especially to Alejandro León Aznar.

Also, several features of RLetters wouldn't be possible without the excellent work of other Ruby programmers.  Thanks in particular to those behind [Ansible,](http://www.ansibleworks.com/) [RSolr](https://github.com/mwmitchell/rsolr) and [RSolr::Ext](https://github.com/mwmitchell/rsolr-ext), and [bibtex-ruby](https://github.com/inukshuk/bibtex-ruby).
